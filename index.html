        <p>Hey my Vireika 🤍</p>

        <p>This is our second Valentine’s together… and honestly, it still feels a bit unreal sometimes. Like how did we go from one birthday message to this whole love, this whole life we’re slowly building together?</p>

        <p>I’ve been thinking about how much you’ve become a part of me. Not just in the obvious ways, like missing you when you’re not around (which is almost always) but in the quiet ways too. The way my days feel better when I hear your voice. The way I want to tell you everything first. The way you’ve become my comfort without even trying.</p>

        <p>I’m just really thankful for you. For your heart, your patience, your softness, your chaos, your love. For choosing me, for staying, for growing with me. I don’t take any of it for granted, not for a second.</p>

        <p>And I know I joke around a lot, but deep down, I mean this so seriously, I want you. Forever. I want to marry you. I want to build the life we always talk about… the home, the silly routines, the trips we dream of, the late-night talks even when we’re old and tired.</p>

        <p>I want to travel the world with you, see new places through your eyes, collect memories with you in every city. I want to watch us grow, as people, as partners, as best friends. I want to keep choosing you, over and over, for the rest of my life.</p>

        <p>This love isn’t just a Valentine’s thing for me. It’s every day. It’s you being my person. And I’m so proud that I get to call you mine.</p>
        
        <p>Your Love Forever,</p>
        
        <p>Sahilan Mahendran</p>
